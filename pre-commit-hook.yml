# Example of using a community-maintained pre-commit hook for Rust
# -   repo: https://github.com/doublify/pre-commit-rust
#     rev: v1.0 # Use the latest stable tag
#     hooks:
#     -   id: fmt
#     -   id: clippy
#     -   id: cargo-check
#     # Note: 'test' hook might be better run as local if it has specific needs or is slow.
