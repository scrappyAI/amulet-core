# Amulet-Core Project Roadmap & Tech Stack

This document outlines the development roadmap and technology stack for the Amulet-Core project, derived from the `kernel_spec.MD` and `README.MD`. It will be updated as the project progresses.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 0: Refactoring & Core Abstractions (Completed as part of initial Phase 1 work)

*   **0.1. Simplify State Handling:**
    *   Refactored `StateDelta` and `SystemState` to use `Entity<Vec<u8>>` for serialized entity bodies, removing `EncodedStateForDelta`.
    *   Updated `EncodedState` trait in `primitives/entity.rs` for explicit `encode`/`decode` methods.
    *   Adjusted `kernel.rs` (`runtime`, `materialise_event`) accordingly.
*   **0.2. Introduce Crypto Abstraction Layer:**
    *   Created `crypto` module with `Hasher`, `Signer`, `Verifier`, and `CryptoProvider` traits.
    *   Added `PlaceholderCryptoProvider` for initial compilation and testing.
    *   Made `Kernel` generic over `CryptoProvider` (`Kernel<CP: CryptoProvider>`).
    *   Updated `verify_signature` and CID generation (`generate_cid`, in `materialise_event`) in `kernel.rs` to use the crypto provider abstraction.

### Phase 1: Core Kernel Implementation (Rust) â€” Feature-Complete & Hardening

*   **1.1. Core Data Structures:** (Completed)
    *   Implement `Entity` struct and its invariants (defined, `EncodedState` updated).
    *   Implement `Capability` struct and its invariants (defined).
    *   Implement `Command` struct and its validation logic (defined, `EncodedCmd` updated).
    *   Implement `Event` struct, ensuring append-only nature and bit-exact preservation of unknown fields (Mechanism for unknown field preservation via `Event::additional_fields` implemented; full relay/re-serialization tests pending for Phase 2.4).
*   **1.2. State-Transition Semantics:** (Core Implemented, `runtime` is placeholder)
    *   Implemented the `apply(cmd) â†’ Event` function in `kernel.rs`, including core validation, lclock management, delta application, and event materialization flow.
    *   Implemented `validate(cmd)` logic in `kernel.rs` with checks for capability, alg_suite, expiry, signature (via placeholder), rights, and command lclock.
    *   Implemented `append_delta` for robust state mutation based on `StateDelta`, with its internal invariant checks now extensively covered by property-based tests (see Â§1.7).
    *   The `kernel_spec.md Â§3` requirement `assert delta.respects_invariants()` is fulfilled by the detailed invariant checks within `append_delta`.
    *   Lamport clock overflow condition in `apply` is now correctly handled.
*   **1.3. Cryptographic Suites:** (CLASSIC âœ…, FIPS âœ…  â€” PQC & HYBRID pending)
    *   `AlgSuite` enum defined.
    *   Crypto abstraction layer (`crypto` module with traits) implemented.
    *   **CLASSIC Suite (BLAKE3-256 Â· Ed25519)** â€” complete & unit-tested.
    *   **FIPS Suite (SHA-3-256 Â· ECDSA-P-256)** â€” complete & unit-tested.
    *   **PQC Suite (SHAKE-256 Â· Dilithium-L3)** â€” design in progress.
    *   **HYBRID Suite (SHA-3-256 Â· SHAKE-256 Â· Ed25519 Â· Dilithium-L3)** â€” blocked on PQC provider.
    *   **Next (Phase-1 Hardening):**
        *   Add `PQC` provider (Dilithium-L3 via `pqcrypto`/`pqc` bindings).
        *   Add `HYBRID` provider & enforce dual-signature rule (Â§4, kernel_spec.md).
        *   Hook providers into compliance profile selection.
*   **1.4. Runtime Purity & Determinism** â€” principle established; concrete runtimes pending.
*   **1.5. Rights Algebra:** (Completed)
    *   Implemented `RightsMask` and core right constants in `rights.rs`.
    *   Implemented `canonicalise` and `sufficient` functions.
    *   Updated `EncodedCmd` trait with `required_rights()`.
    *   Integrated into `kernel.rs::rights_sufficient`.
    *   Created `rights.md`.
*   **1.6. Time Model:** (Largely Completed)
    *   **Lamport Clock Rules:** Rules 1-5 addressed in `kernel.rs` (`validate_command`, `apply`, `process_incoming_event`). Overflow check in `apply`.
    *   **Vector-Clock Extension (Optional Feature):**
        *   Logic for `vc[replica] = event.lclock` on event creation in `apply`.
        *   Merge logic (`vector_clock::merge_into`) and `process_incoming_event` integration complete.
        *   Compare logic (`vector_clock::compare`) implemented.
        *   Kernel support for enabling/disabling Vector Clocks at instantiation is now implemented (`enable_vector_clocks` flag).
*   **1.7. Hardening Actions**
    *   **âœ…** Forbid `unsafe_code` at crate root and enabled strict Clippy linting locally.
    *   **âœ…** Added property-based tests (`proptest`) for Rights Algebra.
    *   **âœ…** Added Criterion benchmark harness for hash functions (opt-in via `cargo bench --features bench`).
    *   **âœ…** Lamport overflow condition in `apply` fixed and covered by a new property-based test in `prop_lamport.rs`.
    *   **âœ…** Created initial fuzz target stub for `Kernel::apply` in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/kernel_apply.rs` (requires `cargo fuzz init` and manual `fuzz/Cargo.toml` setup by user).
    *   **âœ…** Added property-based tests for `validate_command` (capability expiry and command lclock) in `tests/prop_kernel_validate.rs`.
    *   **âœ…** Added comprehensive property-based tests for `Kernel::append_delta` invariants (`prop_append_delta.rs`).
    *   **ðŸŸ¡** CI integration (clippy, rustfmt, cargo-audit) scaffold to be added in tooling phase.
    *   **âœ…** Expanded fuzz harness with a new target for `Kernel::process_incoming_event`.
    *   **âœ…** Expanded command-validation proptests for `AlgSuiteMismatch`, `InsufficientRights`, and `CapabilityNotFound`.
    *   **ðŸŸ¡** Expand fuzz harness capabilities (e.g., more structured inputs, stateful fuzzing if appropriate) and targets (e.g., `Kernel::apply` with more diverse `EncodedCmd` types once defined, `Kernel::new`, specific crypto provider operations).
    *   **ðŸŸ¡** Further expand command-validation proptests to cover signature verification failures (when mock/faulty crypto-providers allow) and other edge cases, aiming for >90% coverage of `validate_command` logic.
    *   **ðŸŸ¡** Expand test coverage: Established infrastructure for a conformance test-vector suite (`conformance_tests.rs`) with initial vectors for Lamport clock rules and overflow. This complements property-based tests and unit tests for spec-driven scenarios. Further test vectors to be added (see Â§2.1).

### Phase 2: Formal Verification & Rigorous Testing

*   **2.1. Test-Vector Suite:** (Infrastructure established)
    *   Develop an official test-vector suite covering:
        *   Lamport clock rules and interactions. (Initial vectors implemented)
        *   Overflow behavior of Lamport clocks. (Initial vectors implemented)
        *   Hybrid signature verification rules (dual and single).
        *   Rights algebra logic (once fully defined).
    *   Core infrastructure (`conformance_tests.rs`, test runner, basic structures) for defining and running test vectors is in place.
*   **2.2. Formal Modeling (TLA+):**
    *   Create a machine-checked TLA+ model of the kernel.
    *   Prove Safety and Liveness properties against defined invariants (e.g., C-1 to C-8 from `kernel_spec.MD`, though these specific invariant labels need to be identified or defined).
*   **2.3. Property-Based Testing:**
    *   Implement property-based fuzz tests (e.g., using `proptest` crate in Rust).
    *   Derive test properties from traces of the TLA+ model.
*   **2.4. Conformance Gate: Unknown Field Preservation:**
    *   Verify that unknown Event fields are preserved bit-exact when relaying or re-serializing events. (Mechanism for preservation via `Event::additional_fields` implemented in Phase 1.1; dedicated conformance tests for relay/re-serialization during event exchange are pending).

### Phase 3: Documentation & Userland Guidance

*   **3.1. Rights Algebra Specification:**
    *   Create and complete `rights.md` detailing the full Rights Algebra.
*   **3.2. Core System Documentation:**
    *   Document core data structures (`Entity`, `Capability`, `Command`, `Event`) in detail.
    *   Document the kernel message lifecycle and state transition flow.
*   **3.3. Userland Layer Design:**
    *   Provide architectural guidance and best practices for designing and implementing userland layers on top of Amulet-Core.

### Phase 4: Compliance Profiles & Deployment Readiness

    *   Finalize build processes and release candidates.
    *   Prepare materials for community engagement and early adopters.

## Technology Stack

*   **Primary Programming Language:** Rust
    *   *Rationale:* Performance, memory safety, strong type system, and suitability for systems-level programming. Aligns with the project's security and long-term principles.
*   **Formal Verification:** TLA+
    *   *Rationale:* Specified in `kernel_spec.MD` for proving safety and liveness properties. Industry standard for formal specification and verification of concurrent and distributed systems.
*   **Property-Based Testing:** Rust crates such as `proptest`.
    *   *Rationale:* Recommended in `kernel_spec.MD` (e.g., QuickCheck) for generating a wide range of test cases from abstract properties, complementing TLA+ and example-based tests.
*   **Cryptographic Libraries:**
    *   `blake3 = "1.5"` (or latest) - Integrated for CLASSIC suite.

    *   (To be selected for PQC, HYBRID: RustCrypto, PQClean bindings like `liboqs` etc.)
*   **Data Serialization (for external representations):** (To be decided - e.g., `serde` with `bincode`/`prost`/`flatbuffers` or custom)
    *   Internal entity bodies are currently handled as `Vec<u8>` after `EncodedState::encode()`.
*   **Unique Identifiers (ReplicaID):** `uuid` crate (dependency noted).
*   **Build System & CI/CD:** Cargo, GitHub Actions or similar.
    *   *Rationale:* Standard tooling for Rust projects, enabling automated builds, tests, and checks.
